# Mnemon Skill Loop Harness

This directory is the canonical skill loop module. It is host-agnostic: a host
agent keeps its native skill runtime, while Mnemon owns the canonical skill
lifecycle state and the evidence used to evolve it.

## Core Parts

| Part | Role |
| --- | --- |
| HostAgent | Owns the ReAct loop, tool routing, native skill discovery, and subagent execution. |
| Host Skill Surface | The host-native skill directory, such as `.claude/skills`. It is a generated view. |
| Mnemon Skill Library | Canonical skill state under `mnemon-skill-loop/skills/{active,stale,archived}`. |

## Support Assets

| Asset | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `module.json` | Machine-readable loop manifest for standard lifecycle events, assets, state, and host adapters. |
| `env.sh` | Runtime config: canonical skill library, host skill surface, usage log, and proposal paths. |
| `GUIDE.md` | Policy for evidence, review triggers, lifecycle movement, and proposal-first changes. |
| `hooks/*.md` | Four lifecycle reminders. Prime syncs active skills; Nudge records evidence; Compact may trigger review; Remind is no-op by default. |
| `skills/skill_observe.md` | Online evidence capture protocol. |
| `skills/skill_curate.md` | Protocol for starting a curator review. |
| `skills/skill_manage.md` | Approved lifecycle mutation protocol. |
| `subagents/curator.md` | Background reviewer that proposes create, patch, consolidate, stale, archive, or restore actions. |
| Host adapter | Host-specific projection lives outside the module under `harness/hosts/<host>/`. |

## Runtime Directory Protocol

Installed runtime files resolve through one environment config:

```text
$MNEMON_SKILL_LOOP_DIR/
├── env.sh
├── GUIDE.md
├── skills/
│   ├── active/
│   ├── stale/
│   ├── archived/
│   └── .usage.jsonl
└── proposals/
```

`env.sh` defines:

```bash
MNEMON_SKILL_LOOP_ENV=<canonical-state>/harness/skill-loop/env.sh
MNEMON_SKILL_LOOP_DIR=<canonical-state>/harness/skill-loop
MNEMON_SKILL_LOOP_HOST_SKILLS_DIR=<host-agent-config>/skills
MNEMON_SKILL_LOOP_ACTIVE_DIR=$MNEMON_SKILL_LOOP_DIR/skills/active
MNEMON_SKILL_LOOP_STALE_DIR=$MNEMON_SKILL_LOOP_DIR/skills/stale
MNEMON_SKILL_LOOP_ARCHIVED_DIR=$MNEMON_SKILL_LOOP_DIR/skills/archived
MNEMON_SKILL_LOOP_USAGE_FILE=$MNEMON_SKILL_LOOP_DIR/skills/.usage.jsonl
MNEMON_SKILL_LOOP_PROPOSALS_DIR=$MNEMON_SKILL_LOOP_DIR/proposals
```

Protocol skills should never hard-code a Claude Code path. They should resolve
state from these variables or from the path injected by Prime.

## Boundary

The harness does not replace the host skill runtime. It only maintains canonical
skill state and projects `active` skills into the host skill surface at Prime.

The key split is:

```text
GUIDE.md decides when skill evolution behavior is useful.
skill_observe.md records evidence only.
curator.md reviews evidence and proposes changes.
skill_manage.md applies approved changes to canonical state.
prime.sh projects active canonical skills into the host skill surface.
```

## Claude Code Install

Install into the current project:

```bash
bash harness/setup/install.sh --host claude-code --module skill-loop
```

Install globally:

```bash
bash harness/setup/install.sh --host claude-code --module skill-loop --global
```

Remove the installed Claude Code integration while preserving the canonical
skill library:

```bash
bash harness/setup/uninstall.sh --host claude-code --module skill-loop
```
