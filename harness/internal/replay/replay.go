// both policies' rules over the OBSERVED events of the log and diffing their rule results (S8). This is the
// faithful model: a rule handles OBSERVED events and EMITS proposals/denies/jobs — so the candidate's behavior
// change lives in observed->decision, NOT in re-reconciling the already-minted *.proposed events (the prior
// model never ran the candidate's rules at all, so every real rule change passed Clean).
//
// View TIMING matches the server, which evaluates rules at DISPATCH time — BEFORE that tick's reconcile. Shadow
// walks the log in IngestSeq order on a throwaway kernel: a logged *.proposed event is applied (reconciled) to
// evolve canonical state; an OBSERVED event is evaluated against the state BUILT FROM THE PROPOSALS THAT PRECEDE
// IT in the log — i.e. the dispatch-time state, not the final state (evaluating against final state yields a
// false-clean for any version-sensitive rule that diverges at @1 but agrees at @2). Only the logged proposals
// mutate the kernel; the rule evaluations are read-only (S8).
//
// The comparison covers verdict + proposal (type+payload) + job + trusted origin actor + the decision REASONS
// + the rule DIAGNOSTICS. Reasons are NOT advisory: the server writes them verbatim into durable *.diagnostic
// events for deny/warn (the auditable S7 trail), so a Reasons-only reword (e.g. blanking a security deny
