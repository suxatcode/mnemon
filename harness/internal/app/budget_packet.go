// budgetShapeProjection returns a copy of proj whose per-resource Content is shaped to the subscriber's
// context-budget tier (P4b). It is a LOCAL presentation transform on the DERIVED MIRROR (I11: budget
// acts on derived mirrors + pull results, and the LOCAL side decides — the hub is never tier-aware).
// Each resource's fields pass through the owning capability's ShapeByBudget, which keeps the most-recent
// K items and re-renders the header over them. A kind with no catalogued capability passes through
// unchanged (no silent drop). Resources and Digest are left attesting the FULL authoritative scope:
// budget bounds CONTEXT, not authority (the grant scope is the security boundary), and the derived
// mirror renders from Content. The input proj is never mutated (a fresh Content slice + fresh shaped
// maps), so the same projection can also be served unbudgeted elsewhere.
