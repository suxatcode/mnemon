// Budget item caps per tier (P4b). REDUCER-FREE by construction: a tier bounds the COUNT of items the
// local mirror renders (most-recent-first), never a model summary (which would be a reducer — out of
// scope / B1, the no-remote-reducer entry decision). "digest-only" is therefore the minimal
// recent-context tier (the single latest item), "warm" a bounded recent window, "hot" the full set. A
// true semantic-summary digest is a sync-abi-v2 / reducer concern, deliberately deferred.

// ShapeByBudget returns the resource fields shaped for a context-budget tier: it keeps only the
// most-recent K items (K per tier; hot = all) and RE-RENDERS the capability's header over the kept
// subset, so a content-rendered surface — e.g. the memory mirror, which reads the rendered `content`
// field, not the raw item list — actually shrinks. "Most-recent" = the tail of the item list, whose
// order is the local append/import sequence (replica-deterministic, so an offline replay reshapes
// identically — B6). Non-item kinds, an unknown tier, and an already-within-budget set are returned
// UNCHANGED (exact passthrough preserves updated_by and any header the writer set; unknown fails open
// to hot — never silently drops data, the closed-set guard lives at config time in ResolveBudgetTier).
//
// This is a pure LOCAL presentation transform: it never reduces on the hub and never alters authority
// (the grant scope is the security boundary — budget bounds CONTEXT only; B2 remote settles, local decides).
