## 6. Write Pipeline: Remember

`mnemon remember` is the core command for writing memories. It includes a built-in diff step that automatically detects duplicates and conflicts before storage. The write transaction executes atomically within a single SQLite transaction.

### 6.1 Detailed Flow

```
mnemon remember "Chose Qdrant as the vector database" \
  --cat decision --imp 5 --entities "Qdrant,Milvus"
```

**Step 1: Validate Input**
- Category must be one of the six types
- Importance 1-5
- Content must not exceed 8000 characters
- Up to 20 tags and 50 entities

**Step 2: Generate Embedding (outside transaction)**
- If Ollama is available: HTTP POST -> nomic-embed-text -> 768-dim float64 vector
- If unavailable: embedding = nil, falls back to token overlap downstream

**Step 2.5: Built-in Diff (outside transaction, read-only)**

Compute similarity against all active insights:
- **DUPLICATE** (sim > 0.90) → skip insert entirely, return `action="skipped"`
- **CONFLICT/UPDATE** (sim 0.50–0.90) → soft-delete old insight, insert new as replacement
- **ADD** (sim < 0.50) → normal insert

This step uses embedding cosine similarity when available, falling back to token overlap. The `--no-diff` flag disables this check.

**Step 3: Atomic Transaction**

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION
  ⓪ Soft-delete replaced insight (if diff found CONFLICT/UPDATE)
  ① INSERT insight (UUID, content, category, importance, tags, entities, source)
  ② UPDATE embedding (if vector is available)
  ③ Graph Engine: OnInsightCreated
     ├── CreateTemporalEdge    → backbone + 24h proximity
     ├── CreateEntityEdges     → regex + dictionary extraction → co-occurrence links
     ├── CreateCausalEdges     → keywords + token overlap → auto causal edges
     └── CreateSemanticEdges   → cos >= 0.80 auto-link
  ④ RefreshEffectiveImportance → update EI decay values
  ⑤ AutoPrune                 → soft-delete lowest EI when total > 1000
COMMIT
```

**Step 4: Candidate Output (post-transaction, read-only)**
- `FindSemanticCandidates`: Semantic candidates with cos in [0.40, 0.80)
- `FindCausalCandidates`: Causal candidates in the 2-hop BFS neighborhood

**Step 5: JSON Output**

```json
{
  "id": "abc-123",
  "action": "added",
  "diff_suggestion": "ADD",
  "replaced_id": null,
  "edges_created": {"temporal": 2, "entity": 3, "causal": 1, "semantic": 1},
  "semantic_candidates": [
    {"id": "def-456", "content": "...", "cosine": 0.72, "auto_linked": false}
  ],
  "causal_candidates": [
    {"id": "ghi-789", "content": "...", "hop": 1, "suggested_sub_type": "causes"}
  ],
  "embedded": true,
  "effective_importance": 0.85,
  "auto_pruned": 0
}
```

The `action` field indicates what the built-in diff decided: `"added"` (new entry), `"replaced"` (conflict auto-replaced, `replaced_id` contains the old insight ID), or `"skipped"` (duplicate detected, no insert).

After receiving this output, the LLM can evaluate candidates and establish edges it considers appropriate via the `mnemon link` command.

## 7. Read Pipeline: Smart Recall (Default)

`mnemon recall` is Mnemon's core retrieval algorithm. Smart recall is the default mode for all queries. It combines intent detection, multi-signal anchor selection, Beam Search graph traversal, and multi-factor re-ranking to achieve intent-aware graph-enhanced retrieval. Use `--basic` for legacy SQL LIKE fallback.

![Smart Recall Pipeline](../diagrams/03-smart-recall-pipeline.jpg)

### 7.1 Step 1: Intent Detection

Query intent is automatically identified via regex matching:

| Intent | Trigger Patterns |
|--------|-----------------|
| WHY | `why`, `reason`, `because`, `cause`, `motivation`, `为什么`, `原因`, `理由` |
| WHEN | `when`, `time`, `before`, `after`, `timeline`, `什么时候`, `何时`, `时间` |
| ENTITY | `what is`, `who is`, `tell me about`, `是什么`, `谁是`, `关于` |
| GENERAL | None of the above match |

Supports the `--intent` flag to manually override automatic detection.

### 7.2 Step 2: Multi-Signal Anchor Selection (RRF Fusion)

Multiple signals run in parallel and are merged via Reciprocal Rank Fusion:

```
Signal 1: Keyword     → KeywordSearch(all_insights, query, top-20)
Signal 2: Vector      → CosineSimilarity(query_vec, all_embeddings, top-20)
Signal 3: Recency     → sort by created_at DESC, top-20
Signal 4: Entity      → insights sharing entities with the query

RRF Score = Σ  1 / (k + rank_i + 1)    (k = 60)
                 for each signal
```

Each insight may rank differently across signals; RRF fusion produces a robust composite ranking.

### 7.3 Step 3: Beam Search Graph Traversal

Starting from each anchor, Beam Search is performed across the four graphs:

```
for each anchor:
    priority_queue = [(anchor, initial_score)]
    visited = {}

    while budget_remaining:
        node = pop(priority_queue)
        for edge in GetEdgesFrom(node):
            neighbor = edge.target
            structural_score = edge.weight × intent_weight[edge.type]
            semantic_score = cosine(vec_neighbor, vec_query)
            total = score_node + λ₁·structural + λ₂·semantic
            //  λ₁ = 1.0 (structural weight), λ₂ = 0.4 (semantic weight)

            if total > best_score[neighbor]:
                update(neighbor, total)
                push(priority_queue, neighbor)
```

**Adaptive parameters**:

| Intent | Beam Width | Max Depth | Max Visited |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| WHY | 15 | 5 | 500 |
| WHEN | 10 | 5 | 400 |
| ENTITY | 10 | 4 | 400 |
| GENERAL | 10 | 4 | 500 |

WHY queries use a wider beam and deeper traversal because causal chains typically span multiple hops.

### 7.4 Step 4: Multi-Factor Re-Ranking

For all collected candidates, a four-dimensional score is computed and combined via weighted sum:

```
keyword_score  = token_intersection / query_token_count
entity_score   = matched_entities / max(1, query_entities_count)
similarity     = cosine(vec_candidate, vec_query)
graph_score    = (traversal_score - min) / (max - min)   // min-max normalization

final = w_kw·keyword + w_ent·entity + w_sim·similarity + w_gr·graph
```

Weights vary by intent:

| Intent | Keyword | Entity | Similarity | Graph |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|-------|
| WHY | 0.10 | 0.10 | 0.30 | **0.50** |
| WHEN | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.30 | **0.40** |
| ENTITY | 0.20 | **0.40** | 0.20 | 0.20 |
| GENERAL | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.25 |

### 7.5 Step 5: WHY Post-Processing — Causal Topological Sort

If the intent is WHY, an additional topological sort using Kahn's algorithm is performed: results are arranged along causal edges so that **causes come first, effects follow**.

### 7.6 Signal Transparency

Each retrieval result includes a detailed signal breakdown:

```json
{
  "insight": {"id": "...", "content": "..."},
  "score": 0.73,
  "intent": "ENTITY",
  "via": "keyword",
  "signals": {
    "keyword": 0.85,
    "entity": 0.60,
    "similarity": 0.72,
    "graph": 0.45
  }
}
```

This is a unique innovation in Mnemon: **exposing the retrieval pipeline's internal signals to the host LLM**. Since the host LLM has the full conversation context, it can make better re-ranking judgments than any algorithm inside the pipeline.

## 8. Deduplication & Conflict Detection: Diff

![Diff & Dedup Pipeline](../diagrams/07-diff-dedup-pipeline.jpg)

Diff is **built into `remember`** — no separate call needed. When `mnemon remember` is invoked, it automatically runs a diff check before inserting.

When `remember` is called, the built-in diff runs before the transaction:

1. Compute similarity against all active insights (embedding cosine when available, token overlap as fallback)
2. Determine the action based on similarity thresholds:

| Similarity | Action | Behavior |
|------------|--------|----------|
| > 0.90 | **DUPLICATE** | Skip insert entirely, return `action="skipped"` |
| 0.50 ~ 0.90 | **CONFLICT/UPDATE** | Soft-delete old insight, insert new as replacement |
| < 0.50 | **ADD** | Normal insert |

The `--no-diff` flag disables this check for cases where the caller wants unconditional insertion.

### 8.1 Typical Workflow

A single `remember` call handles everything:

```bash
# Single command — diff is automatic
mnemon remember "Chose PostgreSQL to replace SQLite as the primary database" \
  --cat decision --imp 5 --source agent
# → If conflict with existing "Chose SQLite as storage":
#   auto-replaces old insight, returns action="replaced", replaced_id="<old_id>"
# → If duplicate: returns action="skipped"
# → If new: returns action="added"
```
