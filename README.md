LLM agents forget everything between sessions. Context compaction drops critical decisions, cross-session knowledge vanishes, and long conversations push early information out of the window.

Mnemon gives your agent persistent, cross-session memory — a four-graph knowledge store with intent-aware recall, importance decay, and automatic deduplication. Single binary, zero API keys, one setup command.

> **Claude Max / Pro subscriber?** Mnemon works entirely through your existing subscription — no separate API key required. Your LLM subscription *is* the intelligence layer. Two commands and you're done.

### Why Mnemon?

Most memory tools embed their own LLM inside the pipeline. Mnemon takes a different approach: **your host LLM is the supervisor.** The binary handles deterministic computation (storage, graph indexing, search, decay); the LLM makes judgment calls (what to remember, how to link, when to forget). No middleman, no extra inference cost.

| Pattern | LLM Role | Representative |
|---|---|---|
| **LLM-Embedded** | Executor inside the pipeline | Mem0, Letta |
| **File Injection** | None — reads file at session start | Claude Code Memory |
| **MCP Server** | Tool provider via MCP protocol | claude-mem |
| **LLM-Supervised** | External supervisor of a standalone binary | **Mnemon** |

Mnemon also addresses a gap in the protocol stack. MCP standardizes how LLMs discover and invoke tools. ODBC/JDBC standardizes how applications access databases. But how LLMs interact with databases using memory semantics — this layer has no protocol. Mnemon's three primitives — `remember`, `link`, `recall` — form an intent-native protocol: command names map to the LLM's cognitive vocabulary (`remember` not INSERT, `recall` not SELECT), and output is structured JSON with signal transparency rather than raw database rows.

Memory has a **compound interest effect** — the longer it accumulates, the greater its value. LLM engines iterate constantly, skill files cost nearly nothing to write, but memory is a private asset that grows with the user. It is the only component in the agent ecosystem worth deep investment.

## Quick Start

### Install

**Homebrew** (macOS / Linux):

```bash
brew install mnemon-dev/tap/mnemon
```

**Go install**:

```bash
go install github.com/mnemon-dev/mnemon@latest
```

**From source**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mnemon-dev/mnemon.git && cd mnemon
make install
```

**Verify installation**:

```bash
mnemon --version
```

### Claude Code

```bash
mnemon setup
```

`mnemon setup` auto-detects Claude Code, then interactively deploys skill, hooks, and behavioral guide. Start a new session — memory just works.

### [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)

```bash
mnemon setup --target openclaw --yes
```

One command deploys skill, hook, plugin, and behavioral guide to `~/.openclaw/`. Restart the OpenClaw gateway to activate.

### [NanoClaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw)

NanoClaw runs agents inside Linux containers. Use the `/add-mnemon` skill to integrate:

1. Install mnemon on the host (see above)
2. In your NanoClaw project, run `/add-mnemon` — Claude Code will modify the Dockerfile, add a container skill, and set up volume mounts
3. Each WhatsApp group gets its own isolated memory store, with optional global shared memory (read-only)

The skill is available at `.claude/skills/add-mnemon/` in the NanoClaw repo.

### Uninstall

```bash
mnemon setup --eject
```

## How it works

Once set up, memory operates transparently — you use your LLM CLI as usual. Mnemon integrates via Claude Code's [hook system](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks), injecting memory operations at key lifecycle points:

```
Session starts
    │
    ▼
  Prime (SessionStart) ─── prime.sh ──→ load guide.md (memory execution manual)
    │
    ▼
  User sends message
    │
    ▼
  Remind (UserPromptSubmit) ─── user_prompt.sh ──→ remind agent to recall & remember
    │
    ▼
  LLM generates response (guided by skill + guide.md rules)
    │
    ▼
  Nudge (Stop) ─── stop.sh ──→ remind agent to remember
    │
    ▼
  (when context compacts)
  Compact (PreCompact) ─── compact.sh ──→ extract critical insights to remember
```

Four hooks drive the memory lifecycle. **Prime** loads the behavioral guide — a detailed execution manual for recall, remember, and sub-agent delegation. **Remind** prompts the agent to evaluate recall and remember before starting work. **Nudge** reminds the agent to consider remember after finishing work. **Compact** instructs the agent to extract and save critical insights before context compression. **The skill file** teaches command syntax. **The guide** (`~/.mnemon/prompt/guide.md`) defines the detailed rules for when to recall, what to remember, and how to delegate.

You don't run mnemon commands yourself. The agent does — driven by hooks and guided by the skill and behavioral guide.

## Features

- **Zero user-side operation** — install once, memory runs in the background via hooks
- **LLM-supervised** — the host LLM decides what to remember, update, and forget; no embedded LLM, no API keys
- **Hook-based integration** — four lifecycle hooks: Prime (load guide), Remind (recall & remember), Nudge (remember), and Compact (save before compression)
- **Four-graph architecture** — temporal, entity, causal, and semantic edges, not just vector similarity
- **Intent-native protocol** — three primitives (`remember`, `link`, `recall`) map to the LLM's cognitive vocabulary, not database syntax; structured JSON output with signal transparency
- **Intent-aware recall** — graph traversal + optional vector search (RRF fusion), enabled by default for all queries
- **Built-in deduplication** — `remember` auto-detects duplicates and conflicts; skips or auto-replaces
- **Retention lifecycle** — importance decay, access-count boosting, and garbage collection
- **Optional embeddings** — works fully without Ollama; add local [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) for enhanced vector+keyword hybrid search

## Vision

All your local agentic AIs — across sessions and frameworks — sharing one pool of live memory.

```

```

The foundation is in place: a single `~/.mnemon` database that any agent can read and write. Claude Code's hook integration is the reference implementation; OpenClaw uses a plugin-based approach; NanoClaw integrates via container skills and volume mounts. The same pattern can be replicated for any LLM CLI that supports event hooks or system prompts.

The longer-term direction is a **memory gateway**: protocol decoupled from storage engine. The current SQLite backend is the first adapter; the protocol surface (`remember / link / recall`) can sit on top of PostgreSQL, Neo4j, or any graph database. Agent-side optimization (when to recall, what to remember) and storage-side optimization (indexing, graph algorithms) evolve independently. See [Future Direction](docs/design/08-decisions.md#82-future-direction) for details.

## FAQ

**Do different sessions share memory?**
Yes. By default, all sessions use the same `default` store — a decision remembered in one session is available in every future session.

**Can I isolate memory per project or agent?**
Yes. Use named stores to separate memory:

```bash
mnemon store create work        # create a new store
mnemon store set work           # set as default
MNEMON_STORE=work mnemon recall "query"  # or use env var per-process
```

Different agents/processes can use different stores via the `MNEMON_STORE` environment variable — no global state contention.

**Local or global mode?**
`mnemon setup` defaults to **local** (project-scoped `.claude/`), recommended for most users. **Global** (`mnemon setup --global`, installed to `~/.claude/`) activates mnemon across all projects — convenient if you want other frameworks (e.g., OpenClaw) to share memory by forwarding requests through Claude Code CLI, but may add maintenance overhead.

**How do I customize the behavior?**
Edit `~/.mnemon/prompt/guide.md`. This file controls when the agent recalls memories and what it considers worth remembering. The skill file (`SKILL.md`) is auto-deployed and should not need manual editing.

**What is sub-agent delegation?**
Memory writes don't happen in the main conversation. The host LLM (e.g., Opus) decides *what* to remember, then delegates the actual `mnemon remember` execution to a lightweight sub-agent (e.g., Sonnet). This saves tokens and keeps memory operations out of the main context.

## Configuration

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |

**Ollama-specific** (only relevant if using embeddings):

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MNEMON_EMBED_ENDPOINT` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama API endpoint |
| `MNEMON_EMBED_MODEL` | `nomic-embed-text` | Embedding model name |
